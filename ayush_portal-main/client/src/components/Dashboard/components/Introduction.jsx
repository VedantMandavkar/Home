      <h1>Welcome to Ayush Portal</h1>
      <p>
        The Ayush Portal project aims to address the challenges hindering
        entrepreneurial growth in India by providing a unified platform. Despite
        the country's vast potential, aspiring and established entrepreneurs
        face significant barriers such as limited access to mentorship,
        fragmented investor networks, and inadequate sector-specific support.
        This initiative seeks to streamline these processes, foster
        collaboration among stakeholders, and catalyze sustainable economic
        development through enhanced entrepreneurial opportunities and
        innovation across diverse sectors.
